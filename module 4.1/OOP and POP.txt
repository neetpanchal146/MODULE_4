1. What is OOP? List OOP concepts.
   OOP(Object oriented programing)
   It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming.                                                                                                                                                                                                  The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no
   other part of the code can access this data except that function.
   
   
 * List of OOP concepts......
   Class: Class can be defined as a blueprint of the object. It is basically a collection of objects which act
             as building blocks.A class contains data members (variables) and member functions. These member
             functions are used to manipulate the data members inside the class.

   Object: An Object can be defined as an entity that has a state and behavior, or in other words, anything that exists physically 
              in the world is called an object. It can represent a dog, a person, a table, etc. An object means a combination of data
              and programs, which further represent an entity. The benefits of classes and objects include:


2. What is the difference between OOP and POP?
=>OOP refers to Object Oriented Programming. It deals with objects and their properties.
    Data can be hidden using encapsulation. 
    Object functions are linked through message passing.

=>POP refers to Procedural Oriented Programming and deals with programs and functions
    There is no data-hiding mechanism. Data is globally accessible, as there are no access specifiers. 
    Parameter passing is involved in message passing.
